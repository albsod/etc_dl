What and how?
-------------

When you subscribe to the digital edition of Dagens ETC
(see https://www.etc.se), you receive a URL that starts with
"http://gantrack5.com/".  If you open this in a web browser,
the URL of the actual issue is displayed with some added
nonsense.

ETC-dl tries to generate a clean HTTPS URL to the current,
a previous or even a future issue my means of date arithmetic,
and then download it using libcurl.  Run the program with the
-h option for complete usage information.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

1. Install a curl development package, e.g.
   libcurl4-gnutls-dev or libcurl4-openssl-dev
   on Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives

2. Run make

3. Move the single binary to your path, e.g.
   # mv etc-dl /usr/local/bin/


Configuration
-------------

The program will create a configuration file at
"~/.config/etc-dl/config".  This should contain the last
known good date and issue.


Known limitations
-----------------

Problems may arise
  1) if Dagens ETC unexpectedly changes the issue number;
  2) if the URL should take a different form;
  3) if URL access should be blocked.

The first can be fixed by manually updating the config file.
The second problem may also be fixable but requires
development. In the third case, I believe the program
becomes useless.
