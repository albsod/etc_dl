What and how?
-------------

When you subscribe to the digital edition of Dagens ETC
(see https://www.etc.se), you receive a URL that starts with
"http://gantrack5.com/".  If you open this in a web browser,
the URL of the actual issue is displayed with some added
nonsense.

ETC-dl tries to generate a clean HTTPS URL to the current,
a previous or even a future issue my means of date arithmetic,
and then download it using libcurl.  Run the program with the
-h option for complete usage information.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

1. Install the curl library

2. Run make

3. Move the single binary to your path, e.g.
# mv etc-dl /usr/local/bin/


Known limitations
-----------------

The program will stop working
  1) if Dagens ETC doesn't come out a particular day,
     because then the date will increase but not the issue;
  2) if the URL should take a different form;
  3) if URL access should be blocked.

The first can be easily fixed by modifying the KNOWN_DATE
and KNOWN_ISSUE constants and recompiling the program.  The
second may also be fixable but requires a bit more work.
In the third case, I believe the program becomes useless.


Final words
