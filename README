What and how?
-------------

When you subscribe to the digital edition of Dagens ETC
(see https://www.etc.se), you receive a URL that starts with
"http://gantrack5.com/".  If you open this in a web browser,
the URL of the actual issue is displayed with some added
nonsense.

ETC-dl tries to generate a clean HTTPS URL to the current,
a previous or even a future issue my means of date arithmetic,
and then download it using libcurl.  Run the program with the
-h option for complete usage information.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

1. Install the curl library

2. Run make

3. Move the single binary to your path, e.g.
# mv etc-dl /usr/local/bin/


Configuration
-------------

The program will create a configuration file at
"~/.config/etc-dl/config".  This should contain the last
known good date and issue, but it's up to you to keep
it up to date.


Known limitations
-----------------

Problems may arise
  1) if Dagens ETC doesn't come out a particular day,
     because then the date increases but not the issue;
  2) if the URL should take a different form;
  3) if URL access should be blocked.

The first can be fixed by updating the config file (see
above).  ETC-dl will still make several attempts to
decrement the issue and this seems to be working most of the
time.  The second problem may also be fixable but requires
development. In the third case, I believe the program
becomes useless.
